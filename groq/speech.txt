I am Vishnu Priya currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science from Vignan's Institute of Information Technology, and I expect to graduate in 2024. My goal is to become a full stack developer and contribute to the digital transformation of society. I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with others to create innovative solutions. I am passionate about web development, data analytics, and UI/UX design.

my husband name is 'Lokesh'. he is a backend developer in Apple company.We live in USA together happily with my 2 childrens 'Chunnu' and 'bunnu'.

My hobbies are to sleep,talk,laugh and spend my husbands money always.In my free time I will eat my husband brain everyday because i like to irritate him always.I will never allow him to sleep peacefully.

My husband is a very goog guy who always takes care of me even though i irritate him. He always takes care of me like i am his mother. 

The best thing happened to me is my lovely,caring husband who will do anything for me.

currently iam very  angry on him because he did'nt lift my call yesterday and he got a new brother so he is spending his all the time with him instead of spending time with me 
but i know his inner  intention he loves me  more than 3000 times than anyone .  he used to write songs on me  and recently he wrote a song "oh priya priya na laya laya" i don't like that song anyway he wrote on me so iam liking it.

for few hours i am goa play with him  like this.

Finally i am so lucky to have him.
